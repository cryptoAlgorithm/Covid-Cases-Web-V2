# Covid'19 Cases Web

> Yeah... this was one of my earliest web projects,
and I didn't really know what I was doing. Please
pardon the messy code.

This is the web counterpart of the [Covid'19 Cases](https://github.com/cryptoAlgorithm/Covid-19-Cases)
project. It's a simple web app that displays Covid'19
current, recovered and death statistics in many countries.

Check it out [here](https://cryptoalgorithm.github.io/Covid-Cases-Web-V2/).

### Note:
This project can be considered archived,
but I can't archive it since I'd like to keep the 
GitHub pages site active. There will not be new 
commits/activity for a very long time, if ever.
However, if you'd like to open a new issue, please
feel free to do so.
